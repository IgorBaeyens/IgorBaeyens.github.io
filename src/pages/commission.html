                                <p>the body of the character will be sculpted in Zbrush either from scratch or from a base. When the client is happy with the result this is afterwards cleaned up through retopology in Blender. The outfit is done in a similar way.</p>

                                <p>Hair is done through a combination of sculpting and curves depending on the design and reference.</p>
